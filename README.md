Web application for managing hairdressers and beauty salons

The application will have reservation management (agenda), declining files, management of items and suppliers, cash control, etc. The main goal is to have all the basic tools to manage the day to day of a hairdresser or beauty center, in this way workers will be able to save seven times and dedicate it to customers. Due to the evolution of mobile devices and tablets it is impossible to think of developing an application that can only be accessed from a platform. or operating system, therefore, the application will be developed so that it is accessible from various platforms, using the web browser.
